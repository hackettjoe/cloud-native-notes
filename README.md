## Microservices
- Microservices are independently deployable services modeled around a business domain. A microservice architecture is based on multiple collaborating microservices.
- microservices expose the business capabilities that they encapsulate via one or more network endpoints
- They also encapsulate data storage and retrieval, exposing data, via well-defined interfaces

Independent Deployability
- is the idea that we can make a change to a microservice and deploy it into a production environment without having to utilize any other services (this is actually how you
manage deployments in your system)
- To guarantee independent deployability, we need to ensure our services are loosely coupledâ€”in other words, we need to be able to change one service without having to change anything else

Modeled Around a Business Domain
- having a 3-tier architecture isn't a bad choice, however it's typically optimized around a group of people/familiarity
- moving forward software architecture changes and are now grouped around multiple skilled teams to reduce silos
