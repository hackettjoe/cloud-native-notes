## Microservices
- Microservices are independently deployable services modeled around a business domain. A microservice architecture is based on multiple collaborating microservices.
- microservices expose the business capabilities that they encapsulate via one or more network endpoints
- They also encapsulate data storage and retrieval, exposing data, via well-defined interfaces

Independent Deployability
- is the idea that we can make a change to a microservice and deploy it into a production environment without having to utilize any other services (this is actually how you
manage deployments in your system)
- To guarantee independent deployability, we need to ensure our services are loosely coupledâ€”in other words, we need to be able to change one service without having to change anything else

Modeled Around a Business Domain
- having a 3-tier architecture isn't a bad choice, however it's typically optimized around a group of people/familiarity
- moving forward software architecture changes and are now grouped around multiple skilled teams to reduce silos

Owning data
- microservices should NOT share a database
- design a service that asks for data outside of its own purview; this gives the service the ability to decide what is shared and what is hidden
- Having stable interfaces between services is essential if we want independent deployability

Advantages of Microservices
- it does open up new models and deployments for improving scale and robustness of systems
- segregating services by a business domain brings developers ease-of-use when solving software issues, who owns what, etc.
- enhances flexibility
- technology agnostic - as long as your services can communicate with each other via a network

Size
- is an interesting topic but how do you measure a microservice it terms of its size? Lines of code? Application stack?
- a microservice is just that, it's micro in nature
- should be as small as possible yet provide as much functionality as possible
- it's really about two things: 1) how many microservices can you handle?, and 2) define microservice boundaries
